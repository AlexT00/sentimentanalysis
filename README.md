# sentimentanalysis
I'm exploring sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques using NLP to analyze interview data that I have obtained for one of my projects, UTC2409 Understanding Communities.

None of the data in this repository is real. Dummy data is used to protect the confidentiality of the interviewees.

## Literature Review
To evaluate the viability of using NLP in qualitative research, I researched on the following paper to determine the process for which NLP could be used to supplement my research.

Crowston, K., Liu, X., Allen, E., &amp; Heckman, R. (n.d.). Machine learning and rule-based automated coding of qualitative data. Retrieved April 9, 2023, from https://floss.syr.edu/sites/crowston.syr.edu/files/ml_nlp.pdf 
-> Limitation in the use of ML in automated coding

Topic Modelling, OpenVec

-> NLP can potentially miss nuances in the responses. It can however be used to find relevant major themes.
